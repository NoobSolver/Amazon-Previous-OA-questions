#Zombie in Matrix

Given a 2D grid, each cell is either a zombie 1 or a human 0. Zombies can turn adjacent (up/down/left/right) human beings into zombies every hour. Find out how many hours does it take to infect all humans?

Example:

    Input:
    [[0, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]]

    Output: 2

Explanation:
    
    At the end of the 1st hour, the status of the grid:
    [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]]

    At the end of the 2nd hour, the status of the grid:
    [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
